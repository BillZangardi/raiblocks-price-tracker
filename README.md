# raiblocks-price-tracker
I created this after seeing [Zack Shapiro](https://twitter.com/zackshapiro) created a iOS equivalent, and an Android version was not yet available.

Currently available for download in the Google Play Store [RaiBlocks Price Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.billzangardi.raiblocks)

Contributions are always welcome, though this app is written in Kotlin, Java PRs will be considered
